PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

These are the requirements for PixelPost:

- sufficient Webspace: not for PixelPost (around 400 KB), but for your images ;=)
- Apache Webserver or Windows IIS
- PHP, version 4.3.0 or higher
- PHP with GD-lib (compiled with JPG-support), required for thumbnailing
- MySQL version 3.24.58 or higher
- a MySQL database already working. If you have no MySQL Database running, create
  a database first (or ask your hoster to do it for you)

To install PixelPost, it is necessary to check whether your webspace supports
these requirements and to have the following MySQL-database-informations
at hand  before you start to install:

- name of the database-host, often "localhost"
- database username
- database user password
- database name

If you don't have these informations, ask your hoster to provide you with these
informations

If you do not know how to set the file-permissions for the folder, check the
help-file of the ftp-program which you use to upload files or
read here in this very good tutorial

http://www.nucleuscms.org/documentation/tips.html#filepermissions

INSTALL
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Edit the pixelpost.php file (located in /includes/), enter the
   database information there:

   these are the fields, where you must enter the necessary data:

	$pixelpost_db_host      = "localhost"; // database host, often "localhost"
	$pixelpost_db_user      = "replace_me"; // database user
	$pixelpost_db_pass      = "replace_me"; // database user password
	$pixelpost_db_pixelpost = "replace_me"; // database

   If you choose another name for your PixelPost-Tables, change it here,
   replace "pixelpost_" by the table-name-prefix of your choice:

	$pixelpost_db_prefix = "pixelpost_"; // table prefix, leave as is unless you want
	to install multiple blogs on the same database

2. Upload the files into some directory of your liking, but keep
   the directory structure as it is
   it is not necessary to upload the directory "doc" to your webspace

3. Create a folder 'images'  !!!!!!

4. Create a folder 'thumbnails' !!!!!!

5. Set the permissions to the folder 'images' and to the folder 'thumbnails' (chmod 777)

6. Connect to your site and the admin section, for example
   www.yoursite.com/where_you_installed_pixelpost/admin/install.php
   and follow the online instructions.
