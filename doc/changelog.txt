Minor Changes or more information:
==================================

1- valid CSS and CSS separated from code and from template-files
   By this it is easier to edit the layout of your templates

2- UTF-RTL: This template-family is aimed for the use where reading-direction is right-to-left
   and not left-to-right
   We work to increase the CSS-file for these templates even more to delete all visual "bugs"
   which still exist

3- More languages supported and more content in the language-files

4- Pixelpost is fully standard-compliant with RSS-Feed and ATOM-Feed,
    as the image-templates offer AUTODETECT for that code in the header
   (Firefox opens a small orange symbol if he detects something like that).
   In addition, all of default templates of Pixelpost have the link to the ATOM-FEED.

5 - Selective Crop of thumbnails with 12CropImage tool is added

6- CSS, using Underscores which caused problem with Netscape browser, is eliminated

7- Calendar addon is fixed

8- Multi category indexing of photos ist now availabe by default.
   Fully compatible with multi-category feature in the modification section by Mark.

9- Page-by-Page archive v0.6 is added with multi category support (v1.4 special)

10- email field is added to comments.
    Now you can have the email of the person who commented you photo
    This email is visible only in the admin panel

11- Layout of admin panel is substantially improved.
    Thumbs now appear in some larger window in admin>> images list.
    Thumbs are shown in comments along with url and email of the person
    who commented the photo and link to the image.

12- CSS of admin/index.php is now out of the main file.
    Now it is easier to change the layout of admin panel

13- Now users can select between HTML and plain text notification emails on comments.
    HTML notification email provides the thumbnail of the commented image.

14- Now you can post photos based on the local timezone of your time, not the server's time.
    By default the timezone of yours is set to the timezone of the server in the
    installation process.
    You can overwrite timezone offset simply in the in admin panel / options.

15- all language files are updated.
    Two new language variables for singular and plural 'category' are added
    New language files are added (see the list above)
    Please check whether these files are complete (some still contain some english
    text). The language-files are prepared for better language-support, concerning
    months-names and weekdates-names

16- If no exif-information exists at all, no "$lang_flash_not_fired" - information
    will be printed

17- Pixelpost is tested with windows NT servers and no major problem up to now.

18- Now you can upload images at the same minute with no confusion in thumbs.

19- uploaded images get a timestamp-prefix now, so no danger of overwriting existing
    photos with the same file-name

20- Now user can post an entry in three different ways:
     - post immediately
     - post to a specific date
    -  post to the next of the last post.

21- Some serious security issues with v1.3 is resolved in v1.4 and this version is more secure.

22- DB access is improved by setting index columns and keys.

23- The admin panel is now more informative and user-friendly.

24- Full upgrade script integrated in the install.php for v1.3 users.

25- more flexibibility for templates:
    If a template designer includes header.html or footer.html,
    those files will be put at the beginning and end of every template.
    This makes designing sites with common headers, navigation and footers easy.
    Everything will work fine even if you don't have or want to use the headers/footers.

26- Better flexibility to add existing pages to your Photoblog:
    It is not necessary anymore to hack index.php to integrate these pages, about-pages
    for example.
    So now, all you need to do is add a new template and you can link to it without changing
    the code.
    For example, add about_template.html and it will be loaded by index.php?x=about.
    Add info_template.html and you can link to it by index.php?x=info.
    This way, different templates can provide different templates and everything should work.
    Of course, certain tags are still only set based on the standard template you are viewing.

28- Password recovery. Now when you forgot your password for Pixelpost there is no need
    to panic. Just submit the email address you have set in the admin panel and you'll
    receive a new password.

29 - SITE-TITLE and EXIF-information is available now in the comment-popup

30 - comment-popup will work better in browsers (when PopUp-windows are allowed)

     the pixelpost-configuration file is now located here as well as the
     markdown- and the exifer-files

32 - PixelPost now comes with the GNU General Public License.

33 - PixelPost comes now with a collection of "powered by.." graphic files,
     located in the /includes/folder

34 - the templates now contain the exact width- and height- information as there
     are new tags for this. So the templates can be designed more flexible

35 - Corrected all bugs in Beta-Version and two tags are added: <IMAGE_NOTES_CLEAN>
	<IMAGE_THUMBNAIL_NO_LINK> <IMAGE_CATEGORY_PAGED> <SITE_BROWSELINK_PAGED>

36 - GNU licence document added to /doc/-directory as "license.txt".

37 - added the nice pixelpost.png-s to the /include directory.

38 - Paged archive addon now validates.

39 - Copy folder now assigns the first category for every image it adds.

40 - When deleting a comment it does double check if it is an accidental click or not!

41 - Now Pixelpost warns when templates are missing and it do similar things for missing
     language files .

42 - Category link tags now have customizable format. Added two new columns for start
     and ending chateres and with a drop box in the admin panel and a custom formating
     edit box there.

43 - Now the first category by 'id' value is checked by default.

44 - Now user cannot delete the first category (default: id=1).
     Thus, this category can be renamed only.

     moves down to the commenting section. very clean.
